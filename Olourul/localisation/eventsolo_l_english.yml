 oloelec.3.d: "Once my family was going to this forest about 8 kilometres from our house to do what I liked to do best, search for ants. When they arrived our got our stuff out and started to walk into a part of the forest, meanwhile the rest was walking I was searching for his ants and I found a few myrmica nests. We continued to walk and they found an open area with some logs on the ground and I looked for any ants there, I didn’t find ants but I did find a millipede and I took it just for fun and then I said: “Who wants a millipede for pet?” “Oh me.”- Julia said. “I’m going to call him or her Snek, because I want a sneak for a pet but I can’t have it so I will have this.”- She continued. We continued our trip finding a few different ant species and genera, Myrmica, Lasius niger, Lasius brunneus, Formica, but most importantly Snek, the British stripped millipede. When they arrived at our house they gave Snek some food to eat. Snek spent the first few weeks of her life there in the test tube I put her initially. But she was allowed to go out, and what I mean with allowed it that I and Julia would take Snek out and they would let her walk around as long as they were watching. But the first key event happened. Once night Julia was looking at Snek and then she put her back in her test tube and back where the test tube usually went. But then when they went to look in the next morning something happened, Snek escaped. We were very distressed and looking for her everywhere, and I mean everywhere until they gave up, Julia said: “It’s a living thing, it’s probably already gone.” Some hours later I was laying on the floor for who knows why, but then I saw something, Snek sleeping under the window edge. He quickly told his sisters and got the stuff to pick her up and put her back in the test tube. And I said this was a key event because before they wanted to put her in a small container where she had more space, but they were never bothered to do so. Now that Snek had escaped once they didn’t want to her to escape again so they got a small container and I built a small house out of some Legos and placed it inside the container and also some cotton to give humidity. And she lived there until she died. I and Julia were planning how to get her to Spain, because they wanted to take her to Spain with them so she wouldn’t be alone and died. She was small, just 2.4 centimetres, although one of the biggest species in the UK. We continued to do everything they did before, let her out, feed her, and all that stuff, and she lived fine. Then one day Julia was watching her and she gave her to Isabel which then gave it to Tomas (our little brother) which took it to his room, which is also my room and showed it to him, I distressed got Snek and quickly brought her down to her container, but Snek was 100% fine. But then the day later, it happened, Snek was barely moving and Julia was confused why. She then looked around Snek’s body and found a few things. The first one was that she was female; they had never known what gender she was until that moment because Snek wouldn’t stop moving. The second thing was that she was missing about 10 legs. Julia searched around internet although she didn’t get a sure answer, although she did find that there is a bacterium that turns millipede’s legs into little stumps or just they make then disappear like here. But as I said, they weren’t one hundred percent sure that it was that. I then placed her in a place so she wouldn’t escape but didn’t mover her much and put her in her usual place. We then went out to the town centre to do a few things. But then, when they came back they saw Snek motionless, before se at least moved her antennae or some legs, but now nothing, you could touch her and she wouldn’t do anything. Snek was dead. Julia had a drawing that she made of Snek about a month before but now because of her death she coloured it in and wrote in Morse: “Rest in Peace Snek” and wrote the date of the day, and she did all of this while crying for Snek. When I found out I was also sad, I also cried a bit. He had previously modded a game called HoI4 and I made his own mod and made a thing that when you finish it, it gave you a few generals, and one of them was Snek, but this was also about a month before Snek’s death but I decided to actually made her an Event which was basically just like this chapter."
